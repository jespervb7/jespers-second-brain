# Calculate the sizes visuals need to be on a page canvas.

```text
I have a Power BI report that I am building, my canvas size is a height of 1080px by a width of 1920 px. I want you to output the position of each visual based on the following requirements I have. Make sure to output the position for each visual in a table format. Make sure to check your calculations again aftewards

20px between each visual
20px from the edges of the canvas
Allow 80px for a header bar that also adhires to the 20px rules above.
Make sure the pixels are always wholenumbers

I want to have 12 visuals on 1 single page. The visuals should be the same size

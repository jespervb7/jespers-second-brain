# Write a styleguide in /Guides for semantic models
Writing a styleguide for semantic models will help you and others adhere to best practices and give you a set of rules to follow. It should lead to improved business products

## What to include?

- style for semantic models
- mention or show c# scripts for easy renaming from database -> semantic model
- Don't let everything be available in MDX. Only allow specific items in MDX to be queried. Forgo high cardinality columns in Excel cuz it drains the Power Bi capacity.
